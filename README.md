# Product Management Daisies Project

I created this code to support Julia Nechaeva's wonderful project with the article published on Medium:
https://medium.com/pminsider/are-you-the-product-manager-you-really-want-to-be-7bc0148c1bb9

## Getting Started

To use this for you own project, just copy the python code with example input excel.
Disclaimer: Code is quick and dirty and require some documentation and cleaning. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to install few non-standard Python libraries to make it work:

import svgwrite
from svglib.svglib import svg2rlg
from reportlab.graphics import renderPDF, renderPM
from xlrd import open_workbook
